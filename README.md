# Titanic-ML_Project


The Titanic machine learning project is a data science project that uses machine learning to predict whether passengers survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic. The project uses a dataset that contains information about passengers, including their age, gender, ticket class, cabin, and whether they survived. The goal of the project is to understand what factors influenced survival rates on the ship. 
The Titanic dataset contains information about 2,201 people on board the Titanic when it sank. The dataset includes the following four categorical attributes for each person: 
Social class (first class, second class, third class, crewmember)
* Age (adult or child)
* Sex
* Whether or not the person survived
* The target feature, or independent variable, in the Titanic dataset is the Survived column. This column is 1 if the person survived and 0 if not. 
* The Titanic machine learning project is a classic introductory machine learning project for those interested in data science and predictive modeling.
